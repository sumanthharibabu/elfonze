   IT Consulting<br>
   <br>
   IT consulting services are advisory services that help clients assess different technology strategies and, in doing so, align their technology strategies with their business or process strategies. These services support customers’ IT initiatives by providing strategic, architectural, operational and implementation planning. Strategic planning includes advisory services that help clients assess their IT needs and formulate system implementation plans. Architecture planning includes advisory services that combine strategic plans and knowledge of emerging technologies to create the logical design of the system and the supporting infrastructure to meet customer requirements. Operational assessment/benchmarking include services that assess the operating efficiency and capacity of a client’s IT environment. Implementation planning includes services aimed at advising customers on the rollout and testing of new solution deployments.

      Corporate & IT Trainings

At Elfonze we prorate corporate training as a huge aspect wherein it brings about greater productivity, more effective staff, a happier workforce, a positive company culture, lower staff recruitment costs and a healthier bottom line.<br>
We maneuver this to deal with changes using a piecemeal based approach to ensure quality over quantity.<br>
A well-run program attracts the employee to have necessary tools to do their jobs efficiently in an organization.<br>
Laying out things to ponder on and put them to use in real life scenarios of professional space is what we aim to discipline the folks into.<br>
We have a counterproductive strategy of playing around where we focus to have trainings on Code of Conduct, Social Medial Guidelines/Strategies, Data Privacy & Confidentiality Clauses blended along as flavors topped up with topics like Body Language, Verbal & Non-Verbal Skills, Transactional & Negotiation Skills, Stress and Time Management etc.<br>
In a corporate world where we believe EQ is inversely proportional to IQ, we put in the effort to include this on lines for Prevention of Sexual Harassment as well.<br>
